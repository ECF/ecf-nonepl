/**
 * Interface providing runtime access to a remote service. An instance
 * implementing this interface will be returned from the
 * IRemoteServiceContainerAdapter.getRemoteService(IRemoteServiceReference) and
 * may then be used to communicate with a remote service. The methods on this
 * interface support accessing the remote service in several ways:<br/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>callSync -- A synchronous invocation that will block the calling thread
 * until complete (or timeout) and return the result from the remote or throw
 * exception if remote invocation fails or throws exception</li>
 * <li>callAsync/1 -- An asynchronous invocation that will not block the caller
 * thread but rather return a non-<code>null</code> {@link IFuture} instance
 * that can be polled for results.  See {@link IFuture#get()},
 * {@link IFuture#get(long)}, and {@link IFuture#isDone()}.
 * timeout, exception, or successful completion)</li>
 * <li>callAsync/2 -- An asynchronous invocation that will not block the caller
 * thread but rather notify the given listener asynchronously when complete (via
 * timeout, exception, or successful completion)</li>
 * <li>fireAsync -- An asynchronous invocation that will simply execute the
 * remote method asynchronously, but will not provide any response or remote
 * method failure information</li>
 * <li>getProxy -- Access to a local proxy for the remote service that will
 * expose the appropriate interface to the caller, and synchronously call the
 * remote methods when invoked. For example:</li>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * IRemoteServiceReference[] references = serviceContainer
 * 		.getRemoteServiceReferences(null, &quot;java.lang.Runnable&quot;, null);
 * IRemoteService remoteService = serviceContainer.getRemoteService(references[0]);
 * Runnable runnable = (Runnable) remoteService.getProxy();
 * runnable.run();
 * </pre>
