For security purposes, each Application must at all times incorporate the applicable Open AIM Key in a secure, embedded manner. AOL may in its sole discretion limit the number of unique Open AIM Keys made available to you.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>III.</b> <b>THE TOOLS</b></p>
<p class="p9"><b>A. Presence Tools. </b>The Presence Tools offer access to the AOL Messaging Network for the purpose of allowing the display of online presence and activity indication for registered users of the AIM Service. You can use the APIs, Documentation and Presence Indicators to implement Presence on your Site and to display online status and activity indication for registered users of the AIM Service. Clicking on the Presence Indicator for a Screen Name will result in the launch of the AIM Service Client, if installed on the Site user's PC, initiating an AIM Service communication session, or the sending of an instant message using the Web AIM Developer Application.  </p>
<p class="p9"><b>B. Plugin Tools. </b>The Plugin Tools offer access to the AOL Messaging Network for the purpose of creating Plugins to access, "plug into" or interact with the AIM Service Client or a Custom Client as further described in the relevant Documentation.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>C. Custom Client Tools. </b>The Custom Client Tools offer access to the AOL Messaging Network for the purpose of creating Custom Clients as further described in the Documentation.</p>
<p class="p9"><b>D. Web AIM Tools. </b>The Web AIM Tools allow the creation of a web-based Developer Application that provides access to the AOL Messaging Network for the purpose of facilitating IM functionality, obtaining or displaying a user's contact list, or obtaining or displaying other metadata provided by the Web AIM APIs in the Web AIM Open AIM Platform Application. The Web AIM Tools also offer access to the AOL Messaging Network for the purpose of allowing the display of online presence and activity indication for registered users of the AIM Service. This is accomplished on your Site by your implementation of code created with certain APIs, Documentation, and either AOL-provided Presence Indicators or other non-AOL-provided presence indicators of your choice. A Site user clicking on the Presence Indicator for a Screen Name will result in either the launch of the AIM Service Client, if installed on the Site user's PC, initiating an AIM Service communication session or the sending of an instant message using the Web AIM Developer Application. <b> </b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>IV. LICENSES AND RESTRICTIONS ON USE</b></p>

<p class="p9"><b>O. Acknowledgement.</b> The disclaimer of warranty and limitation of damages set forth above are essential elements of the bargain between AOL and you. You agree that AOL would not be able to provide the Tools on an economic basis without such limitations.</p>
