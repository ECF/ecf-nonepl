=Eclipse=

Before we begin to describe the Eclipse Communications Framework (ECF), a basic introduction to Eclipse is in order. If you're already familiar with Ecilpse, you can skip directly to Chapter 2 which starts introducing you to ECF.

==The Projects==

The development work at Eclipse is divided into  numerous top-level projects including the Eclipse Project, the Runtime project, the Modeling project, the Tools project and the Technology project. The Eclipse project contains the core components needed to develop Eclipse like the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) and the Java Development Tools (JDT). New projects are created and new components are added to existing projects on an ongoing basis.
