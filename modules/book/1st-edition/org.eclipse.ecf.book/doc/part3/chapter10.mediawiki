=Core API=

The ECF Core API provides support for all other ECF APIs. This includes distributed identity (ID) services, ECF distributed container (IContainer) interface definition and factory-based container instance creation.

The primary entity in the ECF core API is the distributed container, whose runtime contract is represented by the IContainer interface. ECF protocol providers (e.g. XMPP, ECF generic, IRC, bittorrent, etc) all must create a
class implementing the IContainer core interface.
