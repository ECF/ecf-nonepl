=File Transfer API=

The filetransfer API provides support for both retrieving remote files, and initiating the sending of peer-to peer file transfer. Initiating the asynchronous retrieval of remote files is done via the IRetrieveFileTransferContainerAdapter, and requesting peer-to-peer file transfer is done via the
IOutgoingFileTransferContainerAdapter.
